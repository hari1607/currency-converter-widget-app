# TODOs:
* Have a clickable ‘switch arrow’ to easily switch around the currencies at the click of a button...example: google maps, you can click 'switch arrow' to switch the start and end points
* Countries/union flags for each currency listed in the dropdown
* Determine currency based on the geolocation
* Refresh button to retrieve to determine if the user has the latest currency rates
* Spinner for indicating that the currencies are being retrieved from the api 
* Keep via cache/storage the latest currency rates retrieved from the API is unavailable
* If there is an error with the api, indicate that the api is offline by showing an icon or the last date that the currency api was able to retrieve with a little offline icon
